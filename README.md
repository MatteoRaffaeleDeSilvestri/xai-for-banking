# Interpreting a neural network for regulatory compliance in banking

Banca Virtuosa, a leading financial institution, has identified the need to improve the transparency and comprehensibility of artificial intelligence models used in its systems. To achieve this goal, Banca Virtuosa has launched a project aimed at implementing Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, in accordance with current banking transparency regulations.

Currently, Banca Virtuosa uses pre-trained classification models to analyze and classify critical financial data. However, the lack of transparency in the decisions of these models can compromise customer trust and limit the bank's ability to improve its systems in a targeted manner. Identifying and correcting classification errors is crucial to ensuring accuracy and reliability in the services offered.

**Solution benefits**

1. **Transparency in model decisions:** by implementing XAI techniques such as Grad-CAM, LIME, SHAP, Integrated Gradients, and Occlusion Maps, Banca Virtuosa will be able to generate saliency maps that visually show which elements influence model decisions. This increase in transparency will improve customer and stakeholder trust, demonstrating the reliability and explainability of the classification system's operations.

2. **Continuous performance improvement:** by analyzing saliency maps, Banca Virtuosa will be able to accurately identify areas where the model makes errors, both in correct and incorrect classifications. This detailed analysis will allow for targeted improvements to the model, optimizing its performance and reducing the risk of data misinterpretation.

3. **Regulatory compliance:** the project will ensure that AI models' decisions are explainable, in line with existing regulatory requirements. Transparency of AI decisions is essential for regulatory compliance and corporate governance, particularly in regulated sectors such as finance.

4. **Promotion of innovation:** the use of advanced XAI techniques within Banca Virtuosa will promote innovation in the field of artificial intelligence. This will strengthen the bank's position as a pioneer in the adoption of advanced technologies, allowing customers to be offered increasingly sophisticated and reliable solutions.

**Project details**

1. **Phase 1: using a pre-trained classification model**
    - **Model:** use a pre-trained model, such as DenseNet, from the torchvision library.
    - **Dataset:** apply the model to an image dataset, such as MNIST, to explore its classification decisions.

2. **Phase 2: generation of saliency maps**
    - **XAI techniques:** implement techniques such as Grad-CAM, LIME, SHAP, Integrated Gradients, and Occlusion Maps to generate model saliency maps.

3. **Phase 3: final report**
    - **Dataset description:** detail the origin, structure, and characteristics of the dataset used.
    - **Saliency map analysis:** compare saliency maps for correct and incorrect classes to identify and understand model errors.
    - **Explainable system (optional):** describe a fully explainable system that could perform the same classification, offering further insights into model decisions.

**Project goals**

1. **Model understanding:** use XAI techniques to gain a deep understanding of the inner workings of the pre-trained model.

2. **Decision visualization:** clearly and interpretably visualize which elements influence model decisions through saliency maps.

3. **Error identification:** analyze saliency maps to identify and understand model errors, distinguishing between correct and incorrect classifications.

4. **Creating explainable systems:** if possible, develop or describe a fully explainable system that can perform the same classification, providing further insights into model decisions.

**Project motivation**

Explainable AI techniques are essential for Banca Virtuosa to improve transparency, optimize model performance, and ensure regulatory compliance. With this project, the bank aims to strengthen customer trust, improve operational efficiency, and promote innovation in artificial intelligence.
